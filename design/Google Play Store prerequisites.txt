The summary of the steps are,
1. Generate an upload key and keystore. This can be done using Android Studio Tools (Build->Generate Signed Bundle/Apk). This is a one time step and the key and the passwords have to be saved in a secure place. The same key and passwords need to be used for the future releases.
2. Sign your app with your upload key. This can be done using Android Studio Tools (Build->Generate Signed Bundle/Apk). There is no need of commands from command line. Please choose "Android App Bundle" instead of "Apk" while choosing the build type. You have to use the same key for the future releases. https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/app-signing#sign_release
